Application 2: Report
DataType: Hash Table

Big O Runtimes:
createDataSet() : O(1)
destroyDataSet(): O(m)
numItems()	: O(1)
addElt()	: O(1)
removeElt()	: O(1)
searchID()	: O(1)
getItems()	: O(m)

Reason: In this case, it was mentioned that there were going to be a lot of search functions. Therefore, it was imperative to have an efficient searching algorithm. I utitilized a hash table for this purpose because I knew that if I hashed by ID number, then there would be no need for linear probing.  Since every ID only occurs once, an array with a 1:1 correlation to the ID could store the student records very efficiently. It also meant that addElt(), removeElt(), and searchID() all had complexity of O(1).
