Part 2 Answers:

netstat:
    Outputs a list of active internet connections (excluding servers) and active
    Unix domain sockets (excluding servers). In addition, it identifies the
    connection's protocol, the queue size for sending and receiving, local 
    address, foreign address, and the state of the TCP connection.
ifconfig:
    Allows the user to observe the current state of network interfaces. It also
    provides functionality for setting the IP address and the enabling/disabling
    of an interface. In running simply the command, I was presented with a
    rundown of information on each network interface.
hostname:
    Displays the DNS name of the system. In my experience, "linux60816." It also    
	gives the user the ability to change the hostname.
ping:
    Sends packets continuously (or a specified count) with an echo request. It
    also displays statistics on the packets travel (RTT and %loss).
traceroute:
    Displays all DNS addresses that a packet passes through during transmission
    to a specified host.
telnet:
    Allows the user to open up a connection in the terminal with a given host 
    and port. Commands can be issued from that point on.
host/dig: 
    Performs a DNS lookup. Dig gives more detailed information than host.
route: 
    Manipulates the kernel's routing tables to set up static routes to a
    specified host via a specific interface. The command by itself just displays
    the table.
arp:
    Manipulates the kernel's IPv4 network neighbor cache. It can add/delete 
    entries or display the current content.

UK:	182.28.164.198
    32-bit:	0% loss RTT: 144.451ms
    1048-bit:	0% loss	RTT: 144.468ms
Taiwan: 59.127.26.87
    32-bit:	0% loss	RTT: 146.929ms
    1048-bit:	0% loss	RTT: 147.161ms
US:	www.google.com
    32-bit:	0% loss	RTT: 2.692ms
    1048-bit:	0% loss	RTT: 2.447ms

Servers with a further geographic distance clearly have a longer RTT. From this
data, I can see no correlation with packet loss, but logic would suggest that
the more distance a packet as to travel, the more likely it is to be lost.

Step 5:
a. It opens a console connection to the UMass website. It can take in commands.
b. It returns the HTML of the webpage.
c. index.php, Version 1.1, The text and images are formatted using CSS.

Step 6:
When I attempted to connect with the UK host, my request timed out. With the 
Taiwan host, I was rejected. With Google, connecting to something other than 80
meant I was rejected.
