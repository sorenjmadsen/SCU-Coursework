In the example code, my username is not salagtash, the following program 
code does not execute and the program exits. By changing the conditional

In the circle program, the shell is not equipped for floating point
arithmetic, so we must use the 'bc' command which calls the basic
calculator. In addition, we must scale the pi value for all the decimal
places so that none truncate in the pass to the basic calculator.
