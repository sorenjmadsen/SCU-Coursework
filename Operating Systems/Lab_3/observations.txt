Thread 0 returns before Thread 9 outputs. The iteration number is duplicated occasionally and since Thread 0 is returned before Thread 9 starts, i gets overwritten. This happens before go() can print with the first iteration problem as well. The main loop overwrites i with each iteration before it can be printed/processed by the process. To fix this, we need to store the argument before the print statement. This prevents the output of overwritten values.
