Setting up the Minix image:
	On HOST
1) 	setup vmware
	Prepares VMware for execution.	

2) 	minix-get-image
	Creates a new minix system image. This will overwrite all changes made if run after the first time.

3)	vmware &
	Runs the vmware software while printing debug messages in the console.

	On VM
4) On first boot, enter "root" as the name
5) Set a system password for user root using "passwd"
6) Set up the FTP daemon for communication between host and VM
	tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd
	Initializes the daemon so the local system (host) can connect via FTP.
	NOTE: This will need to be done after every reboot.

Connecting to VM via FTP:
	On VM
1) 	Run "ifconfig" to find the IP address of the virtual machine

	On HOST
2)	ftp <IP address of VM>
3) 	Enter "root" username
4) 	Enter your created password from "passwd"
5) 	Enjoy your connection!

	NOTE: The connection will be lost after a VM reboot.

Changing the Minix kernel:
	Done by altering the message at bootup.
  On VM
1) 	cd /usr/src/kernel
	 Change to the kernel directory to look for keywords about the kernel bootup.
2) 	grep -i copyright *
	 Looks for the keyword "copyright" to find the bootup message.

	On HOST in FTP connection
3)	lpwd
	 Checks the current directory on the local machine for file transfer.
	 If this is not the directory you wish to copy files to, run:
		lcd <target directory>
4) 	cd /usr/src/kernel
	 Changes the currect directory on the VM.
5) 	get <filename>
	 Copies the target file for modication to the local directory on the host.
6) 	Change the just copied file on the host computer to manipulate the kernel boot message.
7)	put<filename>
	 Copies the altered file to the location on the VM. Overwrites the old file if the name
	 is still the same.
8) 	cd /usr/src/
	 Changes to the /usr/src directory for recompiling
9) 	make world
	 Recompiles the kernel, including the changes that were made.
10)	reboot
	 Reboots the VM and initializes the changes made in the recompiled kernel.
11) Enjoy your personalized kernel!
