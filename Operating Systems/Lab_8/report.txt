Least Recently Used:
	Maintains an array of page numbers that adjust for each page swap. In this program, the
	array keeps the most recently used page in the front. On each swap, the least recently used
	element (the last element in the array) is overwritten therefore removing it.

	Page Faults: 9510/10000
	Hit Rate:	 0.0490

First In First Out:
	Maintains a circular array of page number such that it continuously overwrites values in the
	array on each circular pass through. If there is a hit, no action is taken other than adding
	to the hit counter.
	
	Page Faults: 9515/10000
	Hit Rate: 	 0.0485

Second Chance Replacement
	Uses a reference bit in a struct for the page number. In addition, it uses a circular array to
	manage all the pages. On a page fault, the index begins at the head of the array and continues
	until a page has a reference bit of 0. If there is a hit, it sets the reference bit to 1,
	giving it a second chance at survival.

	Page Faults: 9510/10000
	Hit Rate:	 0.0490
