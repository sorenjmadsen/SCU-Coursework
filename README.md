# SCU Coursework

This repository serves as a portfolio for my work done throughout different courses at Santa Clara University. Many of the header files have been created by the instructors, but implementation is done as part of the course work.

## Class Descriptions:
### Data Structures & Algorithms
Instructed by Dr. Yuhong Liu, COEN 12 is a course on advanced data structures implemented in C.

### Programming in Assembly
Instructed by Dr. Moe Amouzgar, COEN 20 is an introductory course to ARM assembly. All of these projects have been implemented alongside C code provided by the instructor.

### Object Oriented Programming in C++
Instructed by Dr. Behnam Dezfouli, COEN 79 is a course teaching object-oriented programming in C++.

### Computer Networks
Instructed by Dr. Salem Al-Agtash, COEN 146 is a course on the fundamentals of computer networking. The classes covers theoretical topics on packet transmission is done. The labs pertain to rudimentary network programming in C.

### Fundamentals of the Internet of Things
Instructed by Dr. Benham Dezfouli as a special elective course, we covered current topics in IoT. Covering everything from models of IoT systems to the specifics of communication protocols, such as Bluetooth, 802.11, and LoRa, to access control, internet protocols (IPv4, IPv6, 6LoWPAN), and application protocols such as HTTP, MQTT, and CoAP. In doing so, we completed labs through the programming of Raspberry Pi's in Python and Cypress boards using WICED Studio and C programming.

### Introduction to Computer Security
Instructed by Dr. Yuhong Liu, COEN 150 is a course that overviews the fundamental concepts of computer security from physical aspects to common types of attacks.

### Applied Cryptography
Instructed by Prof. Shiva Houshmand-Yazdi, CSCI 181 is an extension of a introductory cryptography course. This course went into the fundamental mathematics and 
algorithms used in modern day data protection.

### Web Design I
Instructed by Prof. Arman Elahi, this course dives into the fundamentals of web programming in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
