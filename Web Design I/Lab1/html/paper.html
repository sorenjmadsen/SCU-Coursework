        <p style="text-align:center">One-page Topic Outline for Research Proposal</p>
        <p style='font-weight: bold'> Due Tuesday Oct. 7 in class</p>
        <p>As a reminder, the final 10 page research proposal should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a research question</li>
            <li>why that question is interesting to economists</li>
            <li>some economic theory that gives 
    a hypothesis to test</li>
            <li>this should necessitate a literature review</li>
            <li>identification of a data source (you don't have to get it, but you have to be specific about what it is, what variables it has that you'll use, or how you will construct a data source)</li>
            <li>identification strategy: how will you cleanly demonstrate (econometrically)
    the effect you're seeking to find?</li>
            <li>explain the direction of the expected results
    this should have already been done if the previous sections are done correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal of this one-page outline is to make sure that you get started on 
    the right track with an answerable question.</p>

    Your outline should include
        <ul>
            <li><p>the research question you'd like to tackle</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px">
            "Does schooling affect earnings?" is not a research question ready to go, "Did xx
            change in schooling law in Quebec impact the profile of male vs. female earnings" is a question that shows you've put some thought into the process,and then you should be able to say why we expect a differential male vs. female response.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are proposing to investigate the impact of a change in law, you should tell
    me about the law.</li>
            <li>If you are proposing to analyze incentives in government behavior,
    you should give background on what those incentives are.</li>
            <li>Some hint that data are availeble for this qustion, or that you're looking into it.</li>
            <li>And a little bit more about some part
    of the project - the data, the literature, or the theory. </li>
        </ul>
