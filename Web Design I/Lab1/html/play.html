        <p style="font-style: italic">September 1959. Three o'clock, Saturday afternoon. The house is
        in disarray. Cardboard boxes are stacked in corners. Some furniture
        has been removed, shelves emptied. Pictures have been removed from 
        the walls and carpets have been rolled and stood on end. Not far from the
        fireplace, Russ sits alone reading a copy of National Geographic. He
        is dressed in pajama top and chinos, socks, no shoes. On a table
        next to him sits a cartoon of ice cream which, from time to time,
        he dips a spoon. Music plays softly on a radio next to him.<br/> <br/>

        After some time, Bev descends the stairs carryings linents to place
        in a cardboard box. As she packs, she stops to look at Russ.</p>

        BEV. You're not going to eat all of that, are you? (He turns down the radio.)<br/>
        RUSS. (With his mouth full.) Whaddya say?<br/>
        BEV. What ice cream is that?<br/>
        RUSS. Um. (Looks at the carton.) Neapolitan.<br/>
        <!-- Side note, strawberry ice cream is not that good -->
        BEV. Well don't feel compelled to eat that.<br/>
        <!-- See, BEV agrees-->
        RUSS. (Shrugs, bareuly audible.) Going to waste. (He turns the radio
        back up and Francine enters from the kitchen, wearing a maid's uniform.
        Russ remains in the foreground as Bev joins her.)<br/>
        FRANCINE. (To Bev.) So, if it's all right I'm just going to put these 
        candlesticks here in the big box with the utensils.<br/>
        BEV. That is what I would do, yes, but you do mean to wrap them first?
        FRANCINE. Oh, yes ma'am.<br/>
