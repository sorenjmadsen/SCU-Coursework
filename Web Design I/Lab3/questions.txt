Task 1:
A.  The overflow determines how the container handles content that exceeds
    the boundaries. When set to hidden, the content will remain hidden. If
    set to auto, then the content is hidden, but a scroll bar is included 
    so the rest of it can be viewed.

B.  The order property adjusts in which order that an element will appear 
    in the page. When set to -1, it makes the item the last in the sequence.

C.  In code.

D.  The push function adds an action to the stack at the very first place,
    pushing all other elements further back.

E.  The pop function returns the element in the very first position, moving 
    all other elements forward after removal.

F.  The defer attribute means that Javascript code is not run until all of 
    the webpage is loaded. If we didn't use defer, we could have to put the
    two statements after the <body>.

What is the difference between margin and padding?

What is 'this' keyword in JavaScript?
